<p>You may have seen this dress already today, it has been dominating Twitter and has even been mentioned on the news.</p>
<p>To some people, it looks black and blue and to others it looks white and gold. What colour does it look like to you? Personally, I see black and blue.</p>
<p>The debate started after singer Caitlin McNeil posted the picture on <a title="Tumblr" href="http://swiked.tumblr.com/post/112073818575/guys-please-help-me-is-this-dress-white-and" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>, asking her followers what colour they thought it was.</p>
<p>WIRED has explained <a title="the science" href="http://www.wired.com/2015/02/science-one-agrees-color-dress/" target="_blank">the science</a> behind the 'illusion'. The answer, in short, is that the dress is blue and black!</p>
