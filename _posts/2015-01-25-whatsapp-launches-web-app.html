<p>A few days ago, WhatsApp published a new <a title="WhatsApp Web" href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/614/WhatsApp-Web" target="_blank">blog post</a>, along with an updated version of their Android, Windows Phone and BlackBerry apps (Yes, you read that correctly. The iPhone does <strong>not</strong> support this feature, due to restrictions in iOS). Announcing a new feature called 'WhatsApp Web'. All messages are still stored on your device, your web browser simply just mirrors this. It is an extension of your phone, rather than a standalone application. However, it is very easy to setup and it looks great!</p>
<p>You just need to visit: <a title="WhatsApp Web" href="http://web.whatsapp.com" target="_blank">web.whatsapp.com</a>Â and you will be presented with a screen like this.</p>

<p>All you need to do is open up WhatsApp on your phone, and select 'WhatsApp Web' and scan the QR code.</p>

<p>Once you have scanned the code, your messages will instantly appear on the screen!</p>

<p>That is all there is to it. It does seem a little slower to send, but would still be much quicker to reply if you are already using your PC. If you are a WhatsApp user and regularly use a computer, I would definitely recommend setting this up right now!</p>
