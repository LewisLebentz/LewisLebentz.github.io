<p>The Raspberry Pi Foundation has announced the release of the Raspberry Pi 2 Model B, the fourth major product released by the company since 2012 when it was formed.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/EbenUpton">Eben Upton</a> (Founder and CEO) announced the release this morning via a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/raspberry-pi-2-on-sale/">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>It is for sale NOW for just Â£22.50 ($35), the same price as the previous Model B+. If you are looking to purchase it, check the stock levels of the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/">official distributors</a> as they are running out of stock fast!</p>
<p>Here are the new specs of the Raspberry Pi 2:</p>
<p>900MHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU<br />
1GB LPDDR2 SDRAM</p>
<p>So it has 2x the amount of RAM, and will be around 6x more powerful than the precious model!</p>
<p>Like the Raspberry Pi (1) Model B+, it has:</p>
<p>4 USB ports<br />
40 GPIO pins<br />
Full HDMI port<br />
Ethernet port<br />
Combined 3.5mm audio jack and composite video<br />
Camera interface (CSI)<br />
Display interface (DSI)<br />
Micro SD card slot<br />
VideoCore IV 3D graphics core</p>
<p>One of the big surprise announcements was one of the new Operating Systems it supports... Windows 10! Microsoft partnered with the Raspberry Pi Foundation to bring Windows 10 to the Pi 2 for FREE!
