<p>The Moto 360 smartwatch, made by Motorola will soon be getting Wi-Fi connectivity, as confirmed today in an <a title="Motorola Blog" href="http://motorola-blog.blogspot.com/2015/04/moto-360-its-time-for-update.html" target="_blank">official blog post</a>.</p>
<p>This is <strong>not</strong> a new device, all existing Moto 360 watches will be able to obtain this functionality after a firmware update due to be released in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>It has been known for a while that it had the capability of using Wi-Fi, but the option had been disabled until now.</p>
<p>There are some concerns over battery life, as the watch struggles to last a day with ambient mode on anyway, enabling the Wi-Fi radio will use up even more power. We'll just have to wait and see!</p>
