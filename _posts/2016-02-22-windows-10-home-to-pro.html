<p>Recently I came across a strange issue when attempting to upgrade from Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Pro edition. I had purchased a laptop that came preinstalled with Windows 10 Home, and to be ready for our office environment, I needed to upgrade to Pro.</p>
<p>I had a Windows 10 Pro license, and a disk with the image on it. However, even after deleting all of the partitions, Windows 10 Home kept coming back!</p>
<p>I tried changing the Product Key to the Pro one, but just received this error code: 0xc004f014 which wasn't helpful at all.</p>
<p>Eventually, I discovered that before entering the Pro key, you have to enter the 'default' Windows 10 Pro key. This then forces the upgrade, but will not activate your system.</p>
<p>To change your Product Key go to the following location:</p>
<p><strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>About</strong> &gt; <strong>Change Product Key or Upgrade Your Edition Of Windows</strong> &gt; <strong>Change Product Key</strong></p>
<p>Once there, enter the below Product Key:</p>
<p><strong>VK7JG-NPHTM-C97JM-9MPGT-3V66T</strong></p>
<p>Your machine will now update to Pro. Once complete, restart the device, and go back to the above location. You should now see the version has changed to Pro!</p>
<p>Enter a valid Windows 10 Pro key by clicking <strong>Change Product Key</strong> once more, and you should be good to go.</p>
