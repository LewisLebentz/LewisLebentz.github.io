<p>Recently in an AMA (Ask Me Anything) on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/2odez1/this_is_oneplus_ask_us_almost_anything/">Reddit</a>, Carl and David from OnePlus answered many of the questions you've all been asking. They have said that we should expect the OnePlus Two to be released in Q2 or Q3 this year. Unfortunately, it is likely that they will use the invite system again, but only for a short period period of time.</p>
<blockquote><p>"It will probably be invite-only for a short period of time, after which pre-orders are rolled out"</p></blockquote>
<p>When asked about the screen size of the next device, OnePlus said they have been listening to the requests for a smaller device. They said that the next device will "surprise people" which sounds quite worrying!</p>
<p>Carl also revealed the company will create multiple different models for each continent to ensure a better range of mobile dataÂ network bands. Currently, only one of the 4G bands in the UK is supported, which could be a significant factor for some people.</p>
