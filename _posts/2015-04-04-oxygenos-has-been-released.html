<p>OxygenOS, the brand new Operating System for the OnePlus One has just been released! Users have been patiently waiting for this day, after many setbacks and delays, it is finally here.</p>
<p>At the moment, it appears to be a very standard AOSP ROM, without many added features, similar to what you might find on Nexus devices. If you would like to update your phone to OxygenOS, you can find the download here:</p>

<p>For those who are not too familiar with flashing ROMs, OnePlus have created a step-by-step guide to instruct you on how to install it. Unfortunately it isn't possible to update via an OTA so you will have to manually install it for now. You can find the guide here:</p>

<p>There are also rumours that CM12S; the OS created by Cyanogen will be released today too. Moderators on the OnePlus forum have said it should be released 'soon' and 'later today' and other sources have said it should be released on Monday.</p>
<p>Will you be installing OxygenOS or CM12S? Personally, I will be waiting to hear the performance of both before making the decision.</p>
