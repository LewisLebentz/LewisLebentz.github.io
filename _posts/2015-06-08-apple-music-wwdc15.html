<p>Apple has just announced 'Apple Music' at their World Wide Developers Conference 2015 (WWDC15). It will allow you to stream millions of songs from their iTunes library competing with services like Spotify. It gives artists their own central page, where they can share updates with fans.</p>
<p>They have also announced a new radio station, Beats One, a global 24/7 radio station, broadcast from LA, New York and London, headed up by Zane Lowe, the ex-Radio 1 DJ.</p>

<p>Unlike other services like Spotify, there will not be a free tier. However, they will be giving everyone 3 months free.</p>
