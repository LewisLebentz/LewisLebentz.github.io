<p>Have you ever forgotten the password to your Mac? Has someone changed it and locked you out? Thankfully, there is an easy way to get back in!</p>
<p>Follow these steps to get back in:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shutdown the Mac</li>
<li>Boot into Recovery Mode by pressing the power button whilst holding 'Command + R'</li>
<li>Choose Disk Utility</li>
<li>At the top menu, select Utilities &gt; Terminal</li>
<li>In terminal type 'resetpassword' and press enter</li>
<li>Select Macintosh HD</li>
<li>Choose your user account</li>
<li>Enter the new password twice and click save</li>
<li>Restart the Mac, and login with the new password!</li>
</ol>
<p>That's great, but now you want to protect your account so others can't reset your password? If you enable FileVault (System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; FileVault) it will encrypt your Hard Drive with your current password. If you do this, and lose your current password there will be no way of getting back in. So be careful!</p>
