<p>Just hours before the official release of the OnePlus 2, some seemingly real photos have emerged online, posted by a user on the XDA Developers Forum, <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=6851063" target="_blank">chinaleakking</a>. He claims to be a beta tester of the phone, and has been using the device for a few weeks.</p>
<p>He has only made one post on the site, here is a quote from the <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-2/general/oneplus-2-exculsive-hands-t3166421" target="_blank">thread</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am a beta tester from China<br />
I have used the new OnePlus 2 for a few week<br />
Ugly design, but the crafting is good<br />
Thicker body, but feel good in hands<br />
Camera has OIS, but not Sony sensor<br />
Home button with fingerprint sensor, not quite sensitive<br />
Oxygen OS not finalize yet, lots of bugs<br />
Prefer OnePlus One more ...</p></blockquote>
<p>And what you've all been waiting for, here are the photos.</p>
<p>What do you think of the leaked photos? Do you think they are real?</p>
