<p>Beware of spoilers! The first four episodes of Game of Thrones Season 5 have been leaked online, on the popular torrent site <a title="KickassTorrents" href="https://kickass.to" target="_blank">KickassTorrents</a>. I won't link to the torrent/magnet file for obvious reasons, but as you may expect they have already become the most popular downloads of the day, with over 55,000 seeders on just one of episodes at time of posting.</p>
<p>You will be able to watch the official version on <a title="HBO" href="http://hbo.com/game-of-thrones" target="_blank">HBO</a> at 9PM this evening.</p>
