<p>Yesterday Google announced it will be restructuring under a new company called Alphabet. This doesn't mean that you will now 'Alphabet it!' instead of 'Google it!', but the parent company of Google, and a few others will now be Alphabet.</p>
<p>Reddit userÂ <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Eipifi" target="_blank">Eipifi</a> has briefly explained what this means <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/3gice6/larry_page_and_sergey_birn_announce_the_alphabet/ctydxvm" target="_blank">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Alphabet is a collection of companies, Google will be one of these (a subsidiary)</p>
<p>Sundar Pichai named a new CEO of Google (!!!)</p>
<p>Alphabet will also include the X lab.</p>
<p>Alphabet Inc. will replace Google Inc. as the publicly-traded entity and all shares of Google will automatically convert into the same number of shares of Alphabet, with all of the same rights.</p>
<p>"This newer Google is a bit slimmed down"</p></blockquote>
<p>You can read Google's official statement on their new website: <a href="http://abc.xyz" target="_blank">abc.xyz</a></p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this new change?</p>
