<p>It's official! Google have just announced that Android Wear devices will now be compatible with iOS. All you need is an iPhone 5 or newer running at least iOS 8.2.</p>
<p>It appears that it won't be lacking any features either, you will be able to use Google Now, see all of your notifications and change the watch face, just like you can on an Android device.</p>
<p>As of today, there is only one device that is compatible, the LG Watch Urbane, however Google's blog says support for devices from Huawei, Asus and Motorola will be coming soon.</p>
